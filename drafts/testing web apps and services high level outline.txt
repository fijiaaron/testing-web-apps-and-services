Introduction
	How testing web applications is different 
	The differences between web sites and applications
	The differences between web applications and web services
	How web services compliment web applications
	Manual testing and test automation

A technical understanding of the web
	A brief history of the internet
	Web sites & web pages
	Browsers
	URLs
	HTML, JavaScript, CSS
	Client/Server and N-Tier architecture
	Networks
		TCP/IP
		Sockets
	Undestanding HTTP
		Requests & Responses
		Request Methods (GET, POST, etc)
		URIs
		HTTP Headers
		Content
		MIME Types
		Response status codes
	Caching, Proxies, Firewalls, etc

Testing web applications

	Testing techniques using the browser
		Browser plugins
	Testing without the browser
		Command line
		Proxy
	Verifying on the server
		SQL
		Log files

	Testing tools
		Browser plugins (REST client, Postman, Firebug)
		Command line tools (telnet, wget, curl)
		HTTP proxies (Fiddler, Charles)
		Network packet analyzers (Wireshark)
		Using firebug

	Additional considerations for testing web applications
		Testing the UI
		Testing on different plantforms 
			browsers, operating systems, and version
		Troubleshooting network issues
		Troubleshooting server-side issues
		Testing Javascript & AJAX
	
	Troubleshooting test failures
		From the client
			ping
			view source
			HTTP status codes
			Stack traces
		From the server
			SSH
			viewing logs
			monitoring the server

	Security Testing
		Input validation
		SQL injection
		Cross site scripting
		HTTPS
		Authentication

	Testing single page web apps
		Testing javascript & AJAX
		AngularJS

	Automating tests
		Automating the browser (Selenium/Webdriver, QTP, SilkTest)
		Simulating the browser (JMeter, HTMLUnit)
		Avoiding the browser (testing at a lower level)

	Using Selenium to create automation
		Selenium IDE
		XPATH & CSS Selectors
		Selenium RC Webdriver
		Using JUnit
		Screenshots
		Writing maintainable tests with Selenium
			Page Objects
		Distributed testing
			Selenium Grid

	Other considerations
		Performance & load testing
		Letency and concurrency

	Considering which strategies to use for testing web applications

Testing Web Services

	Understanding web services
	Differences between SOAP and REST
		What is SOAP
		What is REST	
	RESTful web services explained
		URIs
		Request Methods
		Resources
		Mime Types
		Headers
		Content
		XML or JSON
		Caching 

	Web applications using web services
	
	Mobile apps

	Web services using other web services

	Tools for testing web services
		Using the browser
		Browser plugins
			REST client / Postman
			JSON Viewer

		Command line (telnet, wget)
		Fiddler / Charles proxy
		Curl
